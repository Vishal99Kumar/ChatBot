                <p>Linking the Delhi Airport and New Delhi is the high-speed Delhi Metro Rail. This technological and
                    architectural marvel helps in ease of connectivity between the airport and the rest of Delhi.</p>

                <p>Out of the ten lines interconnecting the Delhi Metro, the Airport Express Line or the "Orange" Line,
                    is a metro line that connects Dwarka Sector 21 to the New Delhi Railway Station, while linking the
                    airport.</p>

                <p>As can be guessed by it's name, the Airport Express Line came into existence to interlink the Indira
                    Gandhi International Airport to prominent points within New Delhi within an estimated travel time of
                    23 minutes.</p>

                <p>A cost-effective way to travel around the city is to use the shuttle bus facility. In order to lower

                    facilities in the world.</p>

                <p>The corporation runs shuttle services every 30 minutes, connecting the airport to the central parts
                    of Delhi, including Connaught Place & Interstate Bus Terminal.</p>
